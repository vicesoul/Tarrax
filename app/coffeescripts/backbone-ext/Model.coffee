    # Method Summary
    #   Trigger an event indicating an item has started to save. This 
    #   can be used to add a loading icon or trigger another event 
    #   when an model tries to save itself. 
    #
    #   For example, inside of the initializer of the model you want
    #   to show a loading icon you could do something like this
    #
    #   @model.on 'saving', -> console.log "Do something awesome"
    #
    # @api backbone override
    save: ->
      @trigger "saving"
      super

    # Method Summary
    #   Trigger an event indicating an item has started to delete. This
    #   can be used to add a loading icon or trigger an event while the
    #   model is being deleted. 
    #
    #   For example, inside of the initializer of the model you want to 
    #   show a loading icon, you could do something like this. 
    #
    #   @model.on 'destroying', -> console.log 'Do something awesome'
